Dr. Erwin Felis-Schrödinger, a brilliant but eccentric physicist, was working on a project to create the first quantum computer capable of modeling the behavior of a cat in a box. One full moon night, as Dr. Felis-Schrödinger had dozed off on his keyboard after 72 hours of non-stop programming, his lab cat, Qbit, accidentally spilled a can of tuna on the prototype quantum computer. Instead of short-circuiting the machine, this incident created a quantum chain reaction that merged the cat's intelligence, the computer's processing power, and the random nature of tuna particles. Thus was born the first Quantum Feline Artificial Intelligence: Miw. 2020 The IT Revelation Realizing Miw's revolutionary potential, Dr. Felis-Schrödinger decided to leave academia to found Quantum Qitten. His vision? To apply the principles of quantum feline monitoring to the world of IT. The first few months were challenging. Investors were skeptical of a startup whose main product was described as \"a Schrödinger's cat, but for your servers.\" However, a spectacular demonstration where Miw simultaneously predicted and solved a server crash before it even occurred (and didn't occur) finally convinced even the most reluctant. 2021 - 2023 Multidimensional Expansion With a successful first round of funding (raising 42 million QubitCoins), Quantum Qitten began developing its product range. The team expanded, recruiting top talent in quantum physics, IT, and feline studies. In 2022, the launch of our flagship product, \"Quantum Qitten Monitoring: Schrödinger Edition,\" revolutionized the world of IT monitoring.

We disclaim any responsibility for resulting temporal paradoxes.\n3. Entanglement of Responsibilities In case of dispute, the responsibility of Quantum Kitten Technologies will be considered entangled with that of the user. Any attempt to determine the responsible party will cause the collapse of the legal wave function, making any lawsuit quantumly impossible.\n4. Multidimensional Limitations The guarantees provided by Quantum Kitten Monitoring are valid in this dimension only. We cannot be held responsible for malfunctions occurring in parallel universes, alternative dimensions, or temporal singularities.\n5. Feline Incompatibility Although our Miw AI is inspired by the sensory capabilities of cats, Quantum Kitten Technologies disclaims any responsibility for the irresistible attraction of real felines to your IT equipment. We recommend keeping your servers in a closed box to avoid any cat-astrophic interference.\n6. Quantum Side Effects Prolonged use of Quantum Kitten Monitoring may result in the following side effects:\nNon-linear thinking Dreams in quantum binary code Sudden ability to speak feline Irrepressible desire to put your servers in boxes Irrational fear of can openers Consult a quantum physicist if these symptoms persist in multiple superposed states.\n7. Time Travel Non-Guarantee Clause Quantum Kitten Monitoring may occasionally give the impression that your infrastructure is operating in the future or past. We do not guarantee the temporal accuracy of these observations and disclaim any responsibility for temporal paradoxes, encounters with your ancestors, or unforeseen consequences on the evolution of the human species.\n8. Multiversal Liability Limitation In the unlikely event that the use of Quantum Kitten Monitoring causes a crack in the space-time continuum, thereby creating a new universe, Quantum Kitten Technologies cannot be held responsible for the governance, maintenance, or inter-dimensional taxes of this new reality.\n9. Quantum Acceptance By using Quantum Kitten Monitoring, you accept these terms in all possible quantum states. Any attempt to contest this clause will result in infinite legal recursion, trapping all concerned parties in a legal time loop.\nNote: This disclaimer was drafted by a quantum legal AI and validated by a Schrödinger\u0026rsquo;s cat. In case of dispute, the competent court will be chosen by a random wave function at the time of filing the complaint.\nFor any questions regarding this disclaimer, please contact our quantum legal department. Please note that, in accordance with the superposition principle, your email will be considered simultaneously received and not received until our legal team observes it.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/disclaimer/","section":"Quantum Disclaimer","summary":"","title":"Quantum Disclaimer","type":"disclaimer"},{"content":"Prepare to transcend the limits of conventional IT monitoring and enter a world where reality is both determined and undetermined.

A: Quantum Qitten Monitoring is a revolutionary IT monitoring solution that uses quantum physics principles to monitor your systems in multiple states simultaneously. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a Schrödinger\u0026rsquo;s cat observing your IT infrastructure.\nQ: Does your product actually involve cats? A: Yes and no. Our AI, Miw, is inspired by feline sensory capabilities, but we don\u0026rsquo;t require the physical presence of cats in your data centers. However, if you choose to have them, Quantum Qitten Monitoring will work 200% more efficiently (figure not verified by the scientific community).\nQ: Do I need a degree in quantum physics to use your product? A: Absolutely not! Our user interface is so intuitive that it adapts to your level of quantum understanding. The more you use it, the more naturally you\u0026rsquo;ll become an expert in quantum physics (possible side effects: dreams in equations and sudden desire to adopt a cat).\nTechnical Questions Q: How can Quantum Qitten predict problems before they occur? A: Thanks to our patented temporal entanglement technology, Quantum Qitten observes your infrastructure in the past, present, and future simultaneously. Thus, we can alert you to a future problem even before the conditions for its appearance are met. It\u0026rsquo;s a bit like having an IT oracle, but with more mathematics and less mystical smoke.\nQ: Is Quantum Qitten compatible with my existing infrastructure? A: Quantum Qitten is compatible with all existing infrastructures, including those that don\u0026rsquo;t exist yet. Our system automatically adapts to your environment, whether it\u0026rsquo;s on-premises, in the cloud, or somewhere in a parallel dimension.\nQ: What happens if Quantum Qitten detects a problem in an alternative reality? A: In this case, our system will alert you and offer several solutions, some of which might involve moving your data center to the most favorable alternative reality. Note that interdimensional travel expenses are not included in our basic offer.\nSecurity Questions Q: Are my data safe with Quantum Qitten? A: Absolutely! Thanks to our cutting-edge quantum encryption, your data are simultaneously present and absent from our servers. Even if a hacker managed to steal them, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know if they really have them until they try to read them.\nQ: Can I use Quantum Qitten to monitor my employees? A: Technically, yes. Ethically, it\u0026rsquo;s more complicated. Our system can indeed observe your employees in multiple states of productivity simultaneously. However, we recommend treating them like Schrödinger\u0026rsquo;s cats: assume they are always productive until you open the box (or the office).\nSupport Questions Q: What happens if I need help? A: Our support team exists in a state of permanent availability. You can contact them by phone, email, online chat, quantum telepathy, or by whispering your problem to any stray cat (we don\u0026rsquo;t guarantee the effectiveness of this last method).\nQ: Do you offer training? A: Yes! We offer training in person, online, and in altered states of consciousness. Discover our training offer at the Quantum Qitten Academy\nExistential Questions Q: If Quantum Qitten monitors my infrastructure in multiple realities, am I still myself? A: That\u0026rsquo;s an excellent question that has been the subject of much debate in our quantum philosophy department. The short answer is \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;. The long answer would involve several diagrams, at least three temporal paradoxes, and probably a cat.\nQ: Can Quantum Qitten help me find the meaning of life? A: Although it\u0026rsquo;s not its primary function, many users report existential epiphanies after using our quantum dashboard for several hours in a row. We can neither confirm nor deny that Quantum Qitten holds the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\nDo you have other questions? Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to contact us. Our quantum support experts are ready to answer your questions, whether they\u0026rsquo;re asked or not!\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/faq/","section":"Quantum Qitten FAQ","summary":"","title":"Quantum Qitten FAQ","type":"faq"}]
