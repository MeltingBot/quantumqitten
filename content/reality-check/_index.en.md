### The Truth About Quantum Qitten

Quantum Qitten doesn't exist (sorry to burst your bubble...)

It's a humorous creation to illustrate that in the world of IT monitoring, you shouldn't rely on extravagant promises and supposedly magical solutions.

### But who could have come up with this quantum idea?

Quantum Qitten is an idea from:

- **Yann Pilpr√©** - CEO of YPSI
- **Victor Coumailleau** - Monitoring Expert at YPSI
