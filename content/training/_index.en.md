Prepare to transcend the limits of conventional IT monitoring and enter a world where reality is both determined and undetermined. Our training programs are designed to transform you into a true master of quantum monitoring.

## Training Programs

### 1. Introduction to Quantum Monitoring (QS-101)

*Duration*: 2 days (or 1 day in a parallel universe)

*Prerequisites*: Basic IT knowledge and willingness to abandon all classical logic

In this course, you will learn:
- The fundamental principles of quantum monitoring
- How to think like Schrödinger's cat
- Basic techniques for observing without (too much) disturbing your systems

### 2. Mastering Miw AI (QS-201)

*Duration*: 3 days (subject to dilation or contraction according to the principle of temporal uncertainty)

*Prerequisites*: QS-101 and ability to communicate with felines (a plus, but not mandatory)

This advanced course covers:
- Advanced communication with Miw AI
- Quantum petting techniques to optimize AI performance
- Resolving IT paradoxes using quantum feline logic

### 3. Multidimensional Troubleshooting (QS-301)

*Duration*: 4 days (simultaneously in multiple dimensions)

*Prerequisites*: QS-201 and troubleshooting experience in at least two parallel realities

Dive into:
- Diagnosing problems existing in superposed states
- Debugging techniques across time and space
- Managing conflicts with your alter-egos from other dimensions

### 4. Quantum Infrastructure Design (QS-401)

*Duration*: 5 days (or instantaneous if you master time dilation)

*Prerequisites*: All previous trainings and a PhD in quantum physics (or feline equivalent)

Learn to:
- Design data centers existing simultaneously in multiple states
- Implement entangled networks on a cosmic scale
- Optimize energy consumption by exploiting quantum vacuum fluctuations

## Certifications

### 1. Quantum Qitten Certified Associate (QQCA)

Go from mere mortal to quantum initiate! This certification proves your ability to exist simultaneously in a state of competence and incompetence.

Exam: 2 hours (or 2 seconds, depending on your perception of time)

Format: Quantum MCQ where all answers are simultaneously correct and incorrect

### 2. Quantum Qitten Certified Professional (QQCP)

Demonstrate your mastery of IT paradoxes and your ability to solve problems before they even appear.

Exam: 4 hours (in this dimension)

Format: Series of practical challenges, including materializing a Schrödinger's cat

### 3. Quantum Qitten Certified Master (QQCM)

The pinnacle of quantum monitoring expertise. Holders of this certification are capable of manipulating IT reality at will.

Exam: Indeterminate duration (the exam ends when it decides you're ready)

Format: A series of mystical trials involving cats, boxes, and possibly creating a mini black hole in a controlled environment

## Certification Process

1. Choose your certification level
2. Prepare by following our trainings (or meditating on the mysteries of the universe)
3. Take the exam in one of our quantum test centers
4. Receive your certification (if the universe allows it)

## Certification Maintenance

To maintain your certification, you must accumulate Quantum Continuing Education Units (QCEU) each year. These units can be obtained by:
- Participating in our interdimensional webinars
- Solving IT paradoxes in your company
- Contributing to research on quantum feline monitoring
