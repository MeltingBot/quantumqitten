Welcome to our quantum FAQ, where all answers exist in a state of superposition until you read them!

## General Questions

### Q: What is Quantum Qitten Monitoring?
A: Quantum Qitten Monitoring is a revolutionary IT monitoring solution that uses quantum physics principles to monitor your systems in multiple states simultaneously. It's like having a Schrödinger's cat observing your IT infrastructure.

### Q: Does your product actually involve cats?
A: Yes and no. Our AI, Miw, is inspired by feline sensory capabilities, but we don't require the physical presence of cats in your data centers. However, if you choose to have them, Quantum Qitten Monitoring will work 200% more efficiently (figure not verified by the scientific community).

### Q: Do I need a degree in quantum physics to use your product?
A: Absolutely not! Our user interface is so intuitive that it adapts to your level of quantum understanding. The more you use it, the more naturally you'll become an expert in quantum physics (possible side effects: dreams in equations and sudden desire to adopt a cat).

## Technical Questions

### Q: How can Quantum Qitten predict problems before they occur?
A: Thanks to our patented temporal entanglement technology, Quantum Qitten observes your infrastructure in the past, present, and future simultaneously. Thus, we can alert you to a future problem even before the conditions for its appearance are met. It's a bit like having an IT oracle, but with more mathematics and less mystical smoke.

### Q: Is Quantum Qitten compatible with my existing infrastructure?
A: Quantum Qitten is compatible with all existing infrastructures, including those that don't exist yet. Our system automatically adapts to your environment, whether it's on-premises, in the cloud, or somewhere in a parallel dimension.

### Q: What happens if Quantum Qitten detects a problem in an alternative reality?
A: In this case, our system will alert you and offer several solutions, some of which might involve moving your data center to the most favorable alternative reality. Note that interdimensional travel expenses are not included in our basic offer.

## Security Questions

### Q: Are my data safe with Quantum Qitten?
A: Absolutely! Thanks to our cutting-edge quantum encryption, your data are simultaneously present and absent from our servers. Even if a hacker managed to steal them, they wouldn't know if they really have them until they try to read them.

### Q: Can I use Quantum Qitten to monitor my employees?
A: Technically, yes. Ethically, it's more complicated. Our system can indeed observe your employees in multiple states of productivity simultaneously. However, we recommend treating them like Schrödinger's cats: assume they are always productive until you open the box (or the office).

## Support Questions

### Q: What happens if I need help?
A: Our support team exists in a state of permanent availability. You can contact them by phone, email, online chat, quantum telepathy, or by whispering your problem to any stray cat (we don't guarantee the effectiveness of this last method).

### Q: Do you offer training?
A: Yes! We offer training in person, online, and in altered states of consciousness. Discover our training offer at the [Quantum Qitten Academy](/training)

## Existential Questions

### Q: If Quantum Qitten monitors my infrastructure in multiple realities, am I still myself?
A: That's an excellent question that has been the subject of much debate in our quantum philosophy department. The short answer is "yes". The long answer would involve several diagrams, at least three temporal paradoxes, and probably a cat.

### Q: Can Quantum Qitten help me find the meaning of life?
A: Although it's not its primary function, many users report existential epiphanies after using our quantum dashboard for several hours in a row. We can neither confirm nor deny that Quantum Qitten holds the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.
