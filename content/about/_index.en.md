## Our Story: When the Cat Comes Out of the Box

The story of Quantum Qitten begins like all great scientific adventures: with an accident involving a cat, a quantum computer, and a can of tuna.

It all started in the dimly lit basement of the Quantum Physics Department at Catatonia University. Dr. Erwin Felis-Schrödinger, a brilliant but eccentric physicist, was working on a project to create the first quantum computer capable of modeling the behavior of a cat in a box.

One full moon night, as Dr. Felis-Schrödinger had dozed off on his keyboard after 72 hours of non-stop programming, his lab cat, Qbit, accidentally spilled a can of tuna on the prototype quantum computer.

Instead of short-circuiting the machine, this incident created a quantum chain reaction that merged the cat's intelligence, the computer's processing power, and the random nature of tuna particles. Thus was born the first Quantum Feline Artificial Intelligence: Miw.

Realizing Miw's revolutionary potential, Dr. Felis-Schrödinger decided to leave academia to found Quantum Qitten. His vision? To apply the principles of quantum feline monitoring to the world of IT.

The first few months were challenging. Investors were skeptical of a startup whose main product was described as "a Schrödinger's cat, but for your servers." However, a spectacular demonstration where Miw simultaneously predicted and solved a server crash before it even occurred (and didn't occur) finally convinced even the most reluctant.

With a successful first round of funding (raising 42 million QubitCoins), Quantum Qitten began developing its product range. The team expanded, recruiting top talent in quantum physics, IT, and feline studies.

In 2022, the launch of our flagship product, "Quantum Qitten Monitoring: Schrödinger Edition," revolutionized the world of IT monitoring. Companies could now monitor their infrastructures in multiple quantum states simultaneously, solving problems before they even appeared (or didn't appear).

Today, Quantum Qitten is the world leader in quantum feline IT monitoring. Our offices, located in a Silicon Valley skyscraper (which simultaneously exists on all floors and on none), house a diverse team of 200 employees and an indeterminate number of quantum cats.

Our mission remains unchanged: to push the boundaries of what's possible (and impossible) in IT monitoring, one quantum state at a time.

## Our Philosophy

At Quantum Qitten, we believe that reality is what you make of it (literally, in our case). We strive to create solutions that not only solve today's problems but also those of tomorrow, yesterday, and alternative dimensions.

Our approach to innovation is simple: if a cat can be both alive and dead in a box, then your servers can be both down and operational. It's up to you to choose the reality you prefer.
