## Feline Co-founder and Head of R&D Department at Quantum Kitten

### Mysterious Origins

Qbit is no ordinary cat. His story begins in a secret laboratory, somewhere between our reality and a parallel dimension:

- **Date of birth**: Unknown (exists simultaneously at multiple ages)
- **Place of birth**: A quantum box in CERN's basement

### Extraordinary Journey

- **Year X**: First observation of Qbit by Dr. Felis-Schrödinger
  - Noted for his ability to be both asleep and awake
- **Year X+2**: First quantum meows recorded
  - Scientists discover that his meows contain complex quantum equations
- **Year X+5**: Awarded the title of "First Quantum Cat" by the International Academy of Feline Physics
- **Year X+7**: Co-founded Quantum Kitten with Dr. Felis-Schrödinger

### Unique Skills

- Ability to exist in multiple quantum states simultaneously
- Meows containing secrets of the universe (still undeciphered to this day)
- Expertise in "quantum cat-culations" and "purr-computing"
- Mastery of quantum teleportation (mainly used to reach the food bowl)

### Notable Research Projects

1. **Schrödinger 2.0 Project**: Improvement of the famous thought experiment, but with a more comfortable box and quantum kibbles
2. **Quantum Claw Initiative**: Development of a computer keyboard usable in all dimensions
3. **Infinite Litter Box Operation**: Creation of a litter box existing in curved space-time for unlimited use

### Anecdotes

- Qbit has the peculiarity of leaving quantum fur that randomly appears and disappears on clothes
- He is the only living being capable of purring in binary
- His favorite toy is a plush mouse that exists simultaneously in all rooms of the company

### Favorite Quote

> "Meow" (Which roughly translates to "The universe is a gigantic quantum litter box, and we're just scratching the surface")

Qbit continues to inspire the Quantum Kitten team with his feline insight and unique quantum intuitions. His biggest dream? 

To create a world where every cat can explore the mysteries of the universe... or simply sleep peacefully in all dimensions at once.
