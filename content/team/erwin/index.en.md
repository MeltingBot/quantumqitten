### Academic and Professional Background

Dr. Erwin Felis-Schrödinger has always had one foot in science and the other... well, somewhere between our dimension and another. Here are the key stages of his journey:

- **1995-1998**: Bachelor's in Physics at the University of Catatonia
  - Thesis: "The influence of lasers on cat behavior towards red dots"
- **1998-2007**: PhD in Quantum Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
  - Dissertation: "Quantum superposition of sleep states in domestic felines"
- **2008-2011**: Researcher at CERN
  - Accidentally created a mini black hole while trying to open a quantum tuna can
- **2011-2019**: Professor of Quantum Physics at the University of Catatonia
  - Developed the most popular course: "Quantum 101: How to be everywhere and nowhere at once"
- **2019-present**: Founder and CEO of Quantum Qitten

### Notable Achievements

- Inventor of the "quantum probability litter box" which is both clean and dirty as long as it's not observed
- Holder of the world record for the longest quantum nap (indeterminate duration)
- Succeeded in being present at 17 conferences simultaneously thanks to his mastery of quantum superposition

### Anecdotes

- Dr. Felis-Schrödinger is known for wearing a tie depicting Schrödinger's equation, which changes pattern depending on the observer
- He has a strange habit of disappearing mid-sentence, only to reappear a few seconds later as if nothing happened
- His office is equipped with a "quantum idea box" that simultaneously generates all possible and impossible ideas

### Current Projects

Dr. Felis-Schrödinger is currently working on a top-secret project aimed at creating the first quantum computer powered exclusively by cat purrs. He is convinced that this is the key to solving all of humanity's problems, or at least to finding the perfect recipe for quantum kibble.
