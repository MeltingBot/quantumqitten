### Academic and Professional Background

Alice Entanglement has always had a gift for being in multiple places at once, which naturally oriented her career towards quantum physics and multidimensional management:

- **2005-2009**: Bachelor's in Quantum Physics, University of Tirana
  - Thesis: "The Art of Taking Notes in Parallel Realities"
- **2009-2011**: Master's in Quantum Management, School of Advanced Studies in Parallel Social Sciences
  - Dissertation: "Organizing Corporate Events in the Multiverse: Challenges and Opportunities"
- **2011-2015**: PhD in Quantum Operations, California Institute of Technology (Caltech)
  - Thesis topic: "Optimizing Workflows Across Dimensions: A Quantum Approach"
- **2015-2020**: Quantum Management Consultant at McQuinsey & Company
  - Developed the "Entanglement Agile" method for multidimensional project management
- **2021-present**: Director of Quantum Operations at Quantum Qitten

### Notable Achievements

- Successfully organized a meeting where all participants were present and attentive in at least three dimensions simultaneously
- Inventor of the "Quantuccino", a drink that boosts you in all parallel realities
- Holder of the world record for "number of tasks accomplished in a single second across parallel universes"

### Unique Skills

- Mastery of "managerial superposition": able to lead multiple teams in different dimensions simultaneously
- Expert in "entangled communication": can transmit information instantly across the multiverse
- Virtuoso of "probabilistic planning": develops strategies that work regardless of the state of the universe

### Ongoing Projects

1. **Operation "Quantum Coffee Break"**: Creation of relaxation spaces existing simultaneously in all dimensions of the company
2. **"Multiversal Brainstorming" Initiative**: Development of a method to harness ideas from all alternative versions of employees
3. **"Meetingless" Project**: Design of a collective decision-making system without the need for physical (or quantum) meetings

### Anecdotes

- Alice once accidentally duplicated the company's coffee machine in 17 parallel universes, causing multidimensional caffeine overconsumption
- She is known for spontaneously appearing in employees' offices just when they think of her
- Her agenda is a walking temporal paradox that only she can decipher

### Favorite Quote

> "In an infinite multiverse, there must be a dimension where Monday morning meetings are enjoyable. My job is to find that dimension and teleport us all there."

### Current Challenges

Alice is currently working on several crucial issues for Quantum Qitten:

1. Finding a way to bill clients in all dimensions where the service was rendered
2. Developing a time-tracking system adapted for employees who exist simultaneously in multiple realities
3. Designing an emergency evacuation plan that works in all possible versions of the company building

Thanks to her unique skills, Alice Entanglement maintains Quantum Qitten's operations in a state of productive superposition, ensuring that the company is always at the forefront of quantum innovation, regardless of the universe observed.
